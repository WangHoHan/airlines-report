# AIRLINES REPORT

The main goal of the project is to create airline report that answers specific kind of questions like "Which days of the week are the worst to travel?". To create PDF flight report I am using R Markdown. The project is based on official United States Department of Transportation database. The code consists of Markown code and R chunks with SQL SELECTS that reads data from imported database. This project is for Database classes on Computer Science at Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan. Please note that the project is written in Polish.
